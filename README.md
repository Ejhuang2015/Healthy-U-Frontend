## Project Overview

Keeping track of habits both good and bad can be challenging. You need a way to record how well you've been able to make changes to your daily habits. Healthy-U's 49 day 'Better U' challenge helps you keep track of habits you want to accomplish on a daily basis, or habits you wish to quit...while also promoting a healthier lifestyle i.e.: drink water, fruits & veggies, meditation, healthy thoughts, etc..
